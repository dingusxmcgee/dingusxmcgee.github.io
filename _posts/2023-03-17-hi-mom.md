Today I was reviewing Crowdstrike High and Critical detections for the entire org.
I came across this CS detection that looked interesting:

Bitsadmin, seems legit.  Rizzohistory.com/img/work.txt ? Gotta be work related!

CS says it blocked the process, which is great. But lets check it out.

Let's start with the parent:


Wscript running a .js file? Apparently wscript will run 'Jscript' files. Never knew that!

What's more interesting is the device path. D: Drive!
After some additional digging in the following days, I discovered the root of this .js file was actually a .iso file of the same name, in fact the user had multiple in their downloads folder!

I was able to remotely connect to the endpoint via Crowdstrike RTR(sorry I didn't take any screenshots) and luckily, the D: drive was still connected. I was able to retrieve the "order-3.JS". Let's see what it looks like in VSCode!
