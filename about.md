Hi!

In my day to day work, I do a lot of Incident response and with that, analyzing malcious file or code from time to time. I am far from an expert, but do my best to post fun and interesting dives into what I find exciting.

I enjoy solving problems and digging into the who-what-where-how-why of how things work.

This blog is an attempt to break out of my shell a little bit and start working on my malware analysis skills. I don't anticipate posting anything beyond that, but you never know. I have recently taken an interest in malware analysis and reverse engineering and would like to catalog my journey a little bit.

You can find me on mastodon, dingusxmcgee@infosec.exchange

Thanks for riding along with me :)
