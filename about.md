Hi!

My names John, but I go by Dingus on the world wide web.

I am currently an Incident Response Engineer at a parent company with many child companies. I was formerly a Technician, a System Administrator and a Security Engineer.

I enjoy solving problems and digging into the who-what-where-how-why of how things work.

I also enjoy being a father and a husband, sometimes reading books, being outside, and sleeping.

This blog is an attempt to break out of my shell a little bit and start working on my malware analysis skills. I don't anticipate posting anything beyond that, but you never know. I have recently taken an interest in malware analysis and reverse engineering and would like to catalog my journey a little bit.

Thanks for riding along with me :)
